function [aic,aicc] = AIC(SS,N,K)

%AIC Akaike's Information Criterion for curve-fitting model comparison
%   AIC(SS,N,K) where SS is the sum of squared residuals (as returned by e.g. lsqcurvefit)
%   N is the number of data points and K is the number of coefficients. 
%   Computes and returns the corrected AIC score for the model.
%   
%   The model with the lowest AIC value is the best fit.

%   NOTE: this computes AIC from sum-of-squares (SS), and thus uses SS as
%   an esimator for the maximum likelihood; when actually fitting
%   distributions using MLE, then use AICL instead!
